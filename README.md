# Steganography_Hiding_Information_in_the_image
📌 Project Description
This project demonstrates how steganography techniques can be used to hide secret text messages within an image. Steganography is the art of concealing information within digital media in a way that prevents detection.
The core idea is to embed information within the least significant bits (LSB) of pixel values so that it does not visibly alter the image.

# 🚀 How It Works
-Encoding Process
The message to be hidden is converted into binary, and each bit is embedded into the LSB of the image pixels.

-Decoding Process
The binary bits are extracted from the image pixels and converted back to readable text.

# 🛠️ Features
Hides any text message inside an image.

Maintains image quality with minimal visible distortion.

Simple Python implementation using PIL and numpy.

Implemented and tested in Jupyter Notebook.

# 📋 Requirements
Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

-Libraries:

numpy

Pillow (PIL)

# You can install the required libraries using:

bash
